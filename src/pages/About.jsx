            <p>
            I am a passionate learning how to be a professional Front End Software Engineer. With less than a year of experience, I have been digging very fast in this amazing world of coding! Previous to coding, I used to be a professional musician and general music teacher. So, I carry the good habits of "practice makes perfect". This transition to code has been for me like switching from an instrument to learn a new one. Or, from learning deeply to speak Spanish to speak English. My big contribution to your team would be enthusiasm, object-oriented, creativity, and resourceful when I don't have the answers.
