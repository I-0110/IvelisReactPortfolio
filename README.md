# IVELIS REACT PORTFOLIO

## Description

Our Ivelis React Portfolio is inspired by the need to create a competitive portfolio that shows the most recent  technology that I have learned. We created this project because using React is an easier way to design and create a beautiful portfolio. We resolved the consuming time to look for codes and inspiration to design a website. Using React, it saves time . We learned that Bootstrap does not work the same in React as it does directly in HTML. If I want to change colors, for example, I need to count with CSS.
